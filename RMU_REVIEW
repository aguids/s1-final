I'm using TRANSPOSE to deal with anything that asks for columns. You said
to submit it anyway and just add this disclaimer.

Greg,

I don't know if this is the correct or intended mindset, but the 6 hours
restriction put me on a "let's get this working" mode. There are a couple of
decisions I regret now, but refactoring would have pushed me beyond the
time limit, so I prefered to stick with it and get the scenario working.

So the overall structure is that the table store the array of rows provided on
creation and whenever there is the need to deal with columns, the row is
transposed to an array of columns, and the column served.


====================


Missing requirements:

- It should be possible to lookup a cell's contents by row (zero based
 index) and column (index or column name).
 (Missing the column name support for cell lookup as there is no Row object so
   table[row_index]["column_name"] doesn't work but
   table["column_name"] returns the whole column)

- It should be possible to do all of the following row manipulations:
    * Run a transformation on a row which changes its content
      based on the return value of a block.
      (Similar to Enumerable#map)

- It should be possible to do the following filtering:
    * Reduce a table to contain only the columns that pass a
      conditional block (similar to Enumerable#select)
