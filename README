Greg,

I don't know if this is the correct or intended mindset, but the 6 hours
restriction put me on a "let's get this working" mode. There are a couple of
decisions I regret now, but refactoring would have pushed me beyond the
time limit, so I prefered to stick with it and get the scenario working.


====================


Missing requirements:

- It should be possible to lookup a cell's contents by row (zero based
 index) and column (index or column name).
 (Missing the column name support for cell lookup)

- It should be possible to do all of the following row manipulations:
    * Run a transformation on a row which changes its content
      based on the return value of a block.
      (Similar to Enumerable#map)

- It should be possible to do the following filtering:
    * Reduce a table to contain only the columns that pass a
      conditional block (similar to Enumerable#select)
