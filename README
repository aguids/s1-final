We should be duplicating, cloning the provided arrays, shouldn't we?

When creating the table or adding rows:
  Should we verify that all rows have the same number of columns?
  And what would be done if there are less, fill with nil?
  And what if there are more, truncate?

When adding columns:
  Should we check that the column has the correct number of rows?
  And what would be done if there are less, fill with nil?
  And what if there are more, truncate?

Do the transformations edit the table in place or return a new one?
  Or should there be both options?

When header support is enabled, is the header considered row 0?




===============

- It should be possible to lookup a cell's contents by row (zero based
 index) and column (index or column name).

- It should be possible to do all of the following row manipulations:
    * Run a transformation on a row which changes its content
      based on the return value of a block.
      (Similar to Enumerable#map)

- It should be possible to do all of the following column manipulations:
    * Append a column to the right side of the table
        (need column name support)
    * Insert a column at any position in the table
        (need column name support)
    * Run a transformation on a column which changes its content
      based on the return value of a block.

- It should be possible to do the following filtering:
    * Reduce a table to contain only the rows that pass a conditional
      block (similar to Enumerable#select)
    * Reduce a table to contain only the columns that pass a
      conditional block (similar to Enumerable#select)
