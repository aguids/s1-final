When creating the table or adding rows:
  Should we verify that all rows have the same number of columns?
  And what would be done if there are less, fill with nil?
  And what if there are more, truncate?

When adding columns:
  Should we check that the column has the correct number of rows?
  And what would be done if there are less, fill with nil?
  And what if there are more, truncate?

Do the transformations edit the table in place or return a new one?
  Or should there be both options?

When header support is enabled, is the header considered row 0?
